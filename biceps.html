  <h2>EZ Bar Curls</h2>
  <p>To perform EZ bar curls, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding an EZ bar with an underhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Keep your elbows close to your body and your upper arms stationary. With your palms facing upward, exhale and curl the bar upward, contracting your biceps. Pause briefly at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, fully extending your arms. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining control and focusing on the contraction of your biceps throughout the movement.</p>

  <h2>Hammer Curls</h2>
  <p>To perform hammer curls, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a pair of dumbbells at your sides with a neutral grip (palms facing in). Keep your elbows close to your body and your upper arms stationary. Exhale and curl the dumbbells upward, focusing on contracting your biceps. Pause briefly at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position, fully extending your arms. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining control and focusing on the contraction of your biceps throughout the movement.</p>
