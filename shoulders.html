  <h1>Shoulder Exercises</h1>

  <h2>Overhead Press</h2>
  <p>To perform an overhead press, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, hold a barbell at shoulder level with an overhand grip, press the barbell upward while keeping your core engaged and avoiding excessive backward lean, and then lower the barbell back down to the starting position with control, maintaining proper form and alignment throughout the exercise.</p>

  <h2>Lateral Raises</h2>
  <p>To do lateral raises, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, hold a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing your body, keep a slight bend in your elbows, raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, pause briefly, then lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position while maintaining control and avoiding swinging or using momentum. Focus on engaging your shoulder muscles and maintaining proper form throughout the movement.</p>

  <h2>Exercise 3</h2>
  <p>To perform face pulls, attach a rope or handles to a cable machine at chest height, grab the handles with an overhand grip, step back to create tension, keep your elbows high and out to the sides, pull the handles towards your face while squeezing your shoulder blades together, and pause briefly at the end of the movement before slowly returning to the starting position. Focus on maintaining proper posture and engaging your rear deltoids and upper back muscles throughout the exercise.</p>
