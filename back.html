  <h1>Back Exercises</h1>

  <h2>Chin Ups</h2>
  <p>To do chin-ups, start by gripping a pull-up bar with your palms facing towards you and your hands shoulder-width apart. Hang with your arms fully extended, then engage your back and biceps to pull yourself up until your chin clears the bar. Lower yourself back down with control, fully extending your arms again, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions. Keep your core engaged, shoulders down and back, and avoid excessive swinging or momentum during the movement.</p>

  <h2>Lat Pull Downs</h2>
  <p>To perform lat pulldowns, sit on a lat pulldown machine with your knees securely tucked under the pads. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip wider than shoulder-width apart. Keeping your back straight and your chest lifted, pull the bar down towards your upper chest by squeezing your lats and pulling your elbows down and back. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement, then slowly return the bar to the starting position with controlled motion. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, focusing on engaging your back muscles throughout the exercise.</p>

  <h2>Bent Over Row</h2>
  <p>To perform a bent over row, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and core engaged. From this position, pull the barbell towards your lower chest by squeezing your shoulder blades together, keeping your elbows close to your body. Pause briefly at the top of the movement, then lower the barbell back down with control. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, focusing on maintaining proper form and engaging your back muscles throughout the exercise.</p>
