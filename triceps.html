  <h1>Triceps Exercises</h1>

  <h2>Tricep Cable Pushdowns</h2>
  <p>To perform tricep cable pushdowns, stand in front of a cable machine with a straight bar attachment at chest height. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, palms facing down. Keep your elbows close to your sides and your upper arms stationary. Exhale and extend your elbows, pushing the bar down until your arms are fully extended. Hold the contraction for a moment, then inhale and slowly return to the starting position, bending your elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, focusing on the contraction of your triceps and maintaining control throughout the movement.</p>

  <h2>Overhead Tricep Extension</h2>
  <p>To perform overhead tricep extensions, stand or sit with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell or an EZ bar above your head with both hands. Keep your upper arms close to your head and your elbows pointing forward. Slowly lower the weight behind your head by bending your elbows. Once your forearms go beyond parallel to the floor, pause for a moment, then exhale as you extend your arms back to the starting position, fully contracting your triceps. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, focusing on maintaining proper form and control throughout the exercise.</p>
