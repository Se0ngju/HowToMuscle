  <h1>Abdominals Exercises</h1>

  <h2>Plank</h2>
  <p>To perform a plank exercise, start by getting into a push-up position, with your hands directly under your shoulders and your toes on the ground. Engage your core muscles and keep your body in a straight line from head to heels. Hold this position for as long as you can, making sure to maintain proper form and breathing steadily. Keep your abs tight and avoid sagging or raising your hips. Aim to gradually increase your plank duration over time to improve core strength and stability.</p>

  <h2>Hanging L-Sit</h2>
  <p>To perform a hanging L-sit, start by hanging from a pull-up bar with an overhand grip. Engage your core muscles and lift your legs together in front of you, keeping them straight and parallel to the ground. Try to hold this position for as long as you can, focusing on maintaining a strong and stable upper body. The hanging L-sit primarily targets the core muscles, including the abs and hip flexors, while also engaging the shoulders and grip strength. It is a challenging exercise that helps improve core stability and overall upper body strength.</p>

  <h2>Cable Crunches</h2>
  <p>To perform cable crunches, kneel down facing away from the cable machine and grab the cable attachment behind your head. With your hips stationary, contract your abs and bend forward at the waist, bringing your elbows towards your knees. Slowly return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of reps. Cable crunches are effective for targeting the abdominal muscles and can help strengthen and tone your abs.</p>
