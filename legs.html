  <h1>Leg Exercises</h1>

  <h2>Squat</h2>
  <p>To perform a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed outward. Engage your core, keep your chest lifted, and lower your body by bending at the hips and knees. Lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the ground or as low as your flexibility allows, ensuring that your knees track over your toes. Push through your heels to return to the starting position, extending your hips and knees. Remember to maintain proper form and alignment throughout the movement and exhale as you rise back up.</p>

  <h2>Deadlift</h2>
  <p>To perform a deadlift, start by standing with your feet hip-width apart and the barbell on the ground in front of you. Bend your knees and hinge at the hips to lower your torso and grip the barbell with an overhand or mixed grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Keep your back straight, engage your core, and lift the barbell by driving through your heels and extending your hips and knees. As you stand up, keep the barbell close to your body and maintain a neutral spine. Lower the barbell back down by reversing the movement, bending at the hips and knees while keeping your back straight.</p>

  <h2>Leg Extensions</h2>
  <p>To perform a leg extension, sit on a leg extension machine with your back against the backrest and your feet under the padded lever. Adjust the machine to align the pad with your lower legs, just above your ankles. Grasp the handles on the sides for support. Extend your legs forward, lifting the lever until your legs are straight, while exhaling. Hold the extended position briefly, then slowly lower the lever back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</p>
