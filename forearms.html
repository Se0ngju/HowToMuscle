  <h1>Forearms Exercises</h1>

  <h2>Wrist Curls</h2>
  <p>Wrist curls are a great exercise for targeting the forearm muscles. To perform wrist curls, sit on a bench or chair with your forearms resting on your thighs and your palms facing up. Hold a dumbbell or a barbell with an underhand grip, allowing your wrists to hang off your knees. Slowly curl your wrists upwards, bringing the weight towards your forearms, and then lower it back down in a controlled manner. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. Wrist curls are effective for strengthening the muscles in your forearms, which can improve grip strength and overall forearm development.</p>

  <h2>Wrist Extensions</h2>
  <p>Wrist extensions are a beneficial exercise for targeting the muscles on the back of your forearms. To perform wrist extensions, sit on a bench or chair with your forearms resting on your thighs and your palms facing down. Hold a dumbbell or a barbell with an overhand grip, allowing your wrists to hang off your knees.
