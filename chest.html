  <h1>Chest Exercises</h1>

  <h2>Bench Press</h2>
  <p>To perform a barbell bench press, lie on a flat bench with your feet firmly on the ground, grip the barbell with a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip, lower the bar to your chest, and then press it back up to the starting position, keeping your elbows tucked and maintaining a stable core throughout the movement.</p>

  <h2>Dumbell Fly</h2>
  <p>To do a dumbbell fly, lie on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand, extend your arms out to the sides with a slight bend at the elbows, lower the weights down in a wide arc motion until you feel a stretch in your chest, then bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position by squeezing your chest muscles.</p>

  <h2>Incline Dumbell Press</h2>
  <p>To perform an incline dumbbell press, set an adjustable bench to an incline angle, hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level with an overhand grip, press the weights up above your chest while keeping your elbows slightly bent, and then lower them back down to the starting position with control, maintaining tension in your chest muscles throughout the movement.</p>
